      <h2>Power Dynamics</h2>
      <p>In this video, Alexandra Canal explains that the pay structure for writers has not kept up with the evolution of broadcast media. Shorter seasons, longer production times, and residual payouts that decrease with each passing year have become the norm for most streaming services. Additionally, entertainment industry giants are scaling back on costs, media production, and implementing mass lay-offs. These conditions are just a few of the factors that contributed to the WGA's decision to go on strike. Canal goes on to explain how the strike could potentially benefit investors who will experience higher profit margins due to the hold on new productions, and international writers who don't fall under the purview of the WGA, both of which could have a negative impact on the WGA's negotiation power.</p>

      <h2>People Over Profits</h2>

      <p>Adam Conover explains that film studios and streaming services are trying to treat writing like gig work despite company profits increasing by 50% in the last ten years. Prior to the strike, the WGA proposed a set of protections that would allow for more financial and career stability in the streaming era, all of which were rejected by the AMPTP. Conover goes on to speak in detail about a few of the demands made by the WGA, all of which are pre-existing regulations that the WGA wants to extend to writers working in stream media. When asked if he believes their demands were rejected due to cost constraints, Conover argues that just one network executive made enough profit in a year to meet the demands of the over 11,000 writers struggling to make ends meet under the current union agreements.</p>

      <h2>Artist Versus AI</h2>
      <p>Megan Cerullo talks about how the WGA demands won't actually cost producers any more money, they merely serve to protect writers from being victimized by producer's cost cutting measures. Writers have a justifiable fear that AI will take on the lion's share of the work while writers are relegated to the role of freelance editor. Writers are pushing back, saying they don't want to edit AI generated scripts, have their work edited by an AI, or have their work used to train AI. An important point was made in this video that studios are using successful outliers in the writing industry to skew public perception in regards to the success of media writers and to justify their rejection of the WGA's demands. It's worth repeating that the WGA is not asking for money, only job security and up-to-date legal rights to their work.</p>

      <p>Ellen Stutzman and Danielle Sanchez-Witzel talk about how producers are trying to restructure the way writers are untilized in the industry. Streaming services are refusing to adhere to the same rules and practices developed in the decades of broadcast media. Unlike broadcast media, streaming services have implemented a fixed residual payout stucture that decreases annually and does not reflect the success or viewership of their work. It's also mentioned that the Screen Actor's Guild and the Director's Guild of America are due for a renegotiation when their contracts expire on June 30, 2023. Stutzman notes that entertainment industry workers have "never been more unified," which could lead to negotiations made in soldiarity with the WGA.</p>
